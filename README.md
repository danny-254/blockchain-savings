# Savings Contract

This is a smart contract that acts as a piggy bank for ethereum on the blockchain.

## How it works

After it has been deployed, the smart contract implements a time lock. It locks any funds within it for a minimum period of 365 days. User will therefore have to wait for the specified period of time (approximately 1 year in this case) before they can access funds locked in the contract.

Within this period, however, Ether can be deposited into the contract.
